# Monaco JSON

JSON language plugin for the Monaco Editor. It provides the following features when editing JSON files:
* Code completion, based on JSON schemas or by looking at similar objects in the same file
* Hovers, based on JSON schemas
* Validation: Syntax errors and schema validation
* Formatting
* Document Symbols
* Syntax highlighting

Schemas can be provided by configuration. See [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-json/blob/master/src/monaco.d.ts)
for the API that the JSON plugin offers to configure the JSON language support.

Internally the JSON plugin uses the [vscode-json-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-json-languageservice)
node module, providing the implementation of the features listed above. The same module is also used
in [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) to power the JSON editing experience.
